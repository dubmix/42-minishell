# Minishell

This 42 group project is about creating a simple shell, just like _bash_. Thanks to **Minishell**, we were able to travel through time and come back to problems people faced when _Windows_ didn't exist.

Coded in C with [edrouot](https://github.com/EmilieD8) @42Berlin

## Usage

Warning: `Makefile` is configured for `Linux` use only.

> - Compile with `make`
> - Run with `./minishell`
> - Try out any command you would use in bash
> - Close with `ctrl + d` or the `exit` command

## Restrictions

This project is written in C and 42 norm compliant:

> - All variables have to be declared and aligned at the top of each function
> - One function cannot have more than 25 lines
> - One file cannot have more than 5 functions
> - It is considering cheating to use functions that are forbidden in the subject
